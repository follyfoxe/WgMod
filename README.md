# Wg Terraria Mod
![logo](icon.png)

Very early proof of concept weight gain mod for tModLoader.
[More info](https://forum.weightgaming.com/t/terraria-weight-gain-mod-proof-of-concept)
- Some elements are inspired by [StarPounds](https://github.com/StarPounds/StarPounds)
- Contributions are very much welcome, ideally via this repo

# Features
- Basic weight gain mechanics
- Food items affect weight directly based on their tier (no digestion yet)
- Weight manipulator item (subject to change)
- Granular movement speed and damage reduction

# Installation
Currently there are no pre-packaged binaries. [See the thread](https://forum.weightgaming.com/t/terraria-weight-gain-mod-proof-of-concept)

# TODO
- Arm sprites 1. (3, 4) 2. (5, 6, 7)
- Improve sprites
- More config options
- Test in multiplayer (most likely broken)
