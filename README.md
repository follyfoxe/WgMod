# Wg Terraria Mod
![logo](icon.png)

Very early weight gain mod for tModLoader.
[More info](https://forum.weightgaming.com/t/terraria-weight-gain-mod-proof-of-concept)
- Some elements are inspired by [StarPounds](https://github.com/StarPounds/StarPounds)
- Contributions are very much welcome, ideally via this repo

# Features
- Basic weight gain mechanics
- Food items and obtaining different buffs affect weight
- Treadmill for quickly losing weight

# Optional features
These are turned on by default but can be turned off in the mod's settings
- Granular movement speed and damage reduction
- Player hitbox size increase
- Basic jiggle physics

# Installation
Currently there are no pre-packaged binaries, so you have to compile the source code by yourself. [See the thread](https://forum.weightgaming.com/t/terraria-weight-gain-mod-proof-of-concept)

# TODO
- Test in multiplayer (most likely broken)
- Add checks to prevent the server from loading or running unecessary stuff
